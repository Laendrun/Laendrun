## Intro

*Let me introduce myself quickly (with some bullet points 'cause it's cool)*

- :pushpin: From Switzerland :switzerland:
- :man_technologist: Part-time IT Technician (you know, user support, formation, all of that...)
- :desktop_computer: Student at `42 Lausanne`
- :heart: Big fan of starting a million projects without finishing any one of them (like all good devs I know)

<hr>

## Projects 
*My current projects (also with bullet points for the same reason as above)*

- :desktop_computer: 42 Cursus, click [here](https://github.com/Laendrun/42) to go directly to the repo
- :notebook: [42 Complete Guide](42-cursus.gitbook.io/guide)
	- This is a GitBook we are writing together with [Laura](https://github.com/TheBrisly). In it we explain our complete reasoning for all the 42 projects. It also helps us take note in a central place so that it can help other students that could be stuck on a problem.
- :bulb: Trying some things with a [personal API](https://github.com/Laendrun/personal_api)
	- :old_key: Implemented a simple authentication system
	- :file_cabinet: Communication with a Mongo database
	- :robot: Telegram Bot that uses messages / stickers saved in the DB to send random messages (mainly used to joke around with my friends)
- Personal website (I just now realised the code for my website isn't on GitHub :man_facepalming:)
- :thought_balloon: And a million other projects in my head that I will maybe start someday (I should at least write them down somewhere or I'll forget them)
